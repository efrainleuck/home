type PixelImage = [[Bool]] 
-- A pixel image is a two-dimensional list of booleans.
-- False represents an empty pixel, and True a grey or black pixel. Each pixel image will be 28x28.
type Feature = Int
-- Each pixel location is considered a separate feature for classification. Because the image is
-- 28x28, there are 784 total features.
type Digit = Integer
-- Each image is of a specific digit, 0 through 9. To distinguish the labels or guesses from
-- other numbers, we use a type alias.
type Corpus = [(Digit,[PixelImage])]
